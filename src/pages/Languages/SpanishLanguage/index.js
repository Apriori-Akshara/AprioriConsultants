          <div className={styles.desc}>DELE (Diplomas de Espa√±ol Como Lengua Extranjera) Spanish Diploma - Spanish language proficiency is officially recognised by the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport of Spain through the issuance of DELE diplomas. The Universidad de Salamanca in Spain prepares the exams and is responsible for the overall assessment of all exams, while the Institute Cervantes organises the exam sessions. The DELE is recognised internationally by public and private educational institutions, governments, and organisations and many undergraduate and graduate university courses require it. The exam follows the CEFR guidelines and is valid for a lifetime once you pass the exams. The six levels of the DELE Spanish Diplomas range from the most fundamental (A1) to the most advanced (C2) levels. In India, DELE exams will be held 6 times, from February to November, in Jaipur, Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.
